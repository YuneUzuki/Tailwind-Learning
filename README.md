I'm not in the mood to follow a readme template so let's go templateless!!!!!

This is a repo with not just one, but many different projects. There are smaller-scale projects, inside the folders Projects/Small-Projects, 
and larger-scale projects inside the folders Projects/Large-Projects. NONE of them have real functionality, they're made exclusively to try 
out TailwindCSS and learn it. So even if it has buttons, input boxes, and stuff that SEEMS like it should do something, it doesn't and is 
just there for learning Tailwind purposes. While I am following along a Udemy course - Tailwind CSS from Scratch by Brad Traversy - I am
taking lots of freedom with the projects, both in just making some completely unique and not part of the course, or adding my personal touches
such as using different colors here and there, different images, and usually instead of following along while the instructor does creates each
project, I take a look at it, try to build it myself, and if I get stuck THEN I watch to understand what I was getting wrong

That's it, really, it's just a very simple repo for learning Tailwind

If you want my recommendation on which one to check out first, especially if you came from my LinkedIn post, is the 'introducing-myself' under
the small projects folder. That's the simplest one, it's really just for offering a quick introduction on myself, in both Portuguese and English,
that may clear up any confusions over my github profile lol

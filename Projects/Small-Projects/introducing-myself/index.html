                <p class="font-thin" id="desc-pg-2">This is the simplest of the projects developed in here, but it's mostly cause I decided to post a link to this repo on LinkedIn and thought "well shit someone's gonna be confused at my profile and pronouns and all". So I'm making this for the sake of just, introducing myself.<br><br>So, without beating around the bush too much, I'm transgender, identify as a trans girl. That's why pronouns are she/her in github, also why my name is different in here. I prefer that. The reason I don't use that on LinkedIn however, is cause, as of now, I'm not out publicly. Rn I'm out just to some friends and family. Is putting this info right here for anyone to see dumb and potentially just me coming out publicly? Yeah. Kinda. But it's not like I'm gonna take too long to do so and I am. Not. Changing my online profiles to something I'm less comfortable with just because I wanted to put something on my LinkedIn. Kinda need a job rn y'know lol<br><br>At the moment I'm trying to learn both front and backend. For that, I chose ASP.NET for backend, due to liking C# and being a little bit familiar with the .net framework. As for front-end, I chose TailwindCSS. This is because, Tailwind gives you a lot of freedom, more than something like Bootstrap, and it's quick and fairly easy to do, making it an incredible framework for someone looking for deep customization and doing things quick in the front-end
